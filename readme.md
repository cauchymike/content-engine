Usage
Training the Content Engine
Initialize the content engine with your training data:


training_data = pd.read_csv("sample-data.csv")
content_engine = ContentEngine("mydatabase.db", training_data)
Train the content engine:

content_engine.train()
Using the Chatbot
Initialize the chatbot with user input:


user_input = "Tell me about item 1"
chatbot_response = initialize_chatbot(user_input)
Use the chatbot's response to get recommendations:


recommendations = content_engine.predict(chatbot_response, num=5)
Running Tests
To run the test suite, use the following command:


python -m unittest content_engine_test.py
